3. pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
4. dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged
5. passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
6. pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
7. pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
8. dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged

10. store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip)
